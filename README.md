# iMPS

A python package for simulating infinite matrix product state (iMPS) evolution including

* Single qubit iMPS evolution
* Two qubit iTEBD
* Local observable expectation values
* Bipartite purities and entanglement entropies
* Local transfer matrix extraction and mutual information 

The projected aided in the simulations of
